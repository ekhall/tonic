* State Changes
State changes most commonly occur in references to persons. State changes
occur _through_ Encounters. For example: A person during a telephone call
is prescribed a medication.

Prior to using datomic, individual encounters were linked to date trees. I
would imagine that this is no longer necessary? I forsee two ways to accomplish
this. The first is to add a duration to each Encounter (e.g.
[Encounter, Inpatient Stay: Date+Duration]).

The second is to have separate Admit and Discharge Counters.

A problem with the first is that until an encounter "ends" the duration is
undefined. The duration bounds therefore wouldn't encompass the subsequent events.

The problem with the second is that having two separate events (admission and
discharge) is less clean.

** Example list of events
*** [1/1/2000,08:00-2/1/2000,10:100] Bob Smith is admitted to hospital
*** [1/14/2000,10:00] Bob Smith is prescribed medication
Here, a single event with an included duration encompasses the subequent
prescription of medication.
